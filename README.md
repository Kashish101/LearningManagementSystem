# Learning Management System (LMS)
Introduction
In today's fast-paced education landscape, Learning Management Systems (LMS) are crucial for delivering, managing, and tracking educational content digitally. They serve as centralized platforms for diverse educational needs, fostering personalized learning experiences.

As part of my journey to deepen my technical skills and solve real-life problems, I created an LMS that helps students streamline online classes, assignments, and quizzes, allowing them to prepare more effectively for their courses. I built this project to make a meaningful impact on people's lives and to simplify educational processes.
